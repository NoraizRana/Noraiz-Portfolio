# Noraiz-Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my work as a Front-End Web Developer. It highlights my technical skills, featured projects, and provides a simple way for visitors and potential clients or employers to contact me.  Built with HTML5, CSS3, &amp; Vanilla JavaScript, this site emphasizes clean and responsive UI.
